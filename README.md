# CallFunctionsJS
Must use the browser web console to access results of coding.

-call3Times calls the console log function 3 times.

-nTimes calls the console log function 5 times because the value for the "repeats" argument is set to 5 once the function is called.

-stringMultiply prompts the user for a message input which can be anything, then the coding prompts the user to input 
how many times they'd like to log their message, and finally the coding prompts the user to input how many times they'd like to
multiply their message based on the number of times it is logged.
